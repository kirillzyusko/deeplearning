- [x] 1 - Logistic regression as a neural network
- [x] 2 - Deep Neural Network
- [x] 3 - Convolutional Neural Network
- [ ] 4 - House Number Recognition
- [x] 5 - Applying CNN (binary classification) (*kaggle) <- check test set (need to get test score)
- [x] 6 - Applying CNN (multiclassification) (*kaggle) <- almost the same results in 3 cases - try to add CrossValidation
- [ ] 7 - Recurrent neural network for text analysis
- [ ] 8 - Recurrent neural network for time series analysis <- in progress
